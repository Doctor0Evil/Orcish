IMPORTANT: This is a legal agreement between the individual or entity exercising rights under this License (“Licensee”) and the author(s) or rightsholder(s) identified in the associated project (“Licensor”) for the software and associated materials (the “Software”). By installing, copying, accessing, or otherwise using the Software, Licensee agrees to be bound by the terms of this Human-Integrated-Technology Software License (“License”). If Licensee does not agree to these terms, Licensee must not use the Software.

1. DEFINITIONS

1.1. “Software” means the source code, object code, configuration files, documentation, and any other works included in this project and designated as being licensed under this License.

1.2. “Derivative Work” means any work based upon or incorporating the Software or any portion of it, including modifications, translations, adaptations, compilations, or any other form in which the Software may be recast, transformed, or adapted, in accordance with applicable copyright law.

1.3. “Use” means to run, execute, install, access, interact with, or otherwise benefit from the functionality of the Software.

1.4. “Human-Integrated Operation” means Use of the Software in which one or more human users remain responsible for oversight, review, and ultimate decision-making in any context where the Software may materially affect real persons, property, finances, safety, rights, or legal interests.

1.5. “Non-Fictive Use” means Use of the Software for real-world, reality-anchored purposes and not for misrepresenting machine-generated artifacts as wholly human-created where such misrepresentation would be materially misleading or fraudulent.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

2.1. Subject to Licensee’s compliance with this License, Licensor hereby grants Licensee a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable (except as expressly permitted in Section 3), transferable only as part of a compliant distribution, perpetual license to:

(a) Use the Software for any Non-Fictive Use, including internal, commercial, research, and educational purposes, provided such Use is Human-Integrated Operation where the Software may have material real-world impact;

(b) Reproduce the Software in whole or in part;

(c) Modify the Software and create Derivative Works;

(d) Distribute the Software and Derivative Works in source or object form, under this License or under different terms, provided that Sections 4, 5, and 6 remain satisfied with respect to the Software itself.

3. REDISTRIBUTION CONDITIONS

3.1. Any redistribution of the Software, in source or object form, with or without modification, must:

(a) Include a copy of this License text;

(b) Retain all copyright, attribution, and notice statements contained in the Software, to the extent reasonably practicable;

(c) Clearly identify any material modifications made by Licensee, including at least: (i) the fact of modification, and (ii) the date of such modification.

3.2. If Licensee distributes Derivative Works that incorporate substantial portions of the Software, Licensee must not represent such Derivative Works as created solely by humans where AI-generated or tool-assisted content is material to the Derivative Work.

3.3. Licensee may impose additional terms on Derivative Works, provided such terms do not conflict with or purport to limit the rights granted by this License with respect to the unmodified portions of the Software.

4. HUMAN-INTEGRATED AND NON-FICTIVE USE REQUIREMENTS

4.1. Human Oversight. Where the Software is used in any context that may materially impact health, safety, financial outcomes, legal status, employment, education, or other significant rights or interests of real persons, the Software must be used only as part of a Human-Integrated Operation. Human users must retain authority to review, approve, override, or reject outputs produced by the Software.

4.2. Non-Fictive Attribution. Licensee must not knowingly use the Software to misrepresent machine-generated or machine-assisted outputs as exclusively human authored in any context where such misrepresentation would reasonably be considered deceptive, fraudulent, or materially misleading (for example, legal filings, regulatory submissions, medical records, or consumer-facing communications presented as solely human-authored).

4.3. Prohibited Uses. The Software must not be used:

(a) To intentionally generate fabricated evidence, records, or documentation presented as genuine in legal, regulatory, medical, or financial proceedings;

(b) To deliberately bypass, disable, or defeat lawful safety, security, or compliance controls of third-party systems;

(c) In any manner that is prohibited by applicable law or regulation.
